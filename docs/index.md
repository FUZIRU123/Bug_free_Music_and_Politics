## Abstract
The present study examines online users’ political fragmentation by network analysis based on their co-commenting on popular singers’ music videos and political candidates’ news videos. Focusing on YouTube, a popular video social networking sites, the present study constructed a network among 10 singers and 10 news outlets if they shared the same commenting user. Results indicate that singers are strongly connected to news outlets, suggesting the spillover of politics into popular culture.

## Background
According to the report of the Pew Research Centre in the U.S. Politics and Policy, the 2014 report pointed out that compared with any time in the past two decades, Republicans and Democrats are more ideologically divided-partisan resentment is more profound. And broad. These trends are manifested in many ways in politics and daily life. The YouTube channel is a very popular social media channel for people to view politics and culture news. We can make some observations if the channels on this social media are fragmented according to politics.
Youtube has a very strong connection with American politics. In 2008, some major political party candidates started using YouTube to announce their candidacy and track announcements made through more traditional media. Not only do individual users share videos on YouTube, business organizations and government organizations also open accounts on the platform and use it as an important media promotion platform. Social celebrities will also actively play the role of opinion leaders on Youtube. First of all, YouTube is the communication in politics, which is the communication of ordinary people. Secondly, there is also the communication between politicians and the people. Politicians will communicate with the people, and there will also be the communication and debate between politicians.
This study is guided by the influence of lifestyle politics and political stance on popular culture. This study promotes the research route of audience fragmentation, which makes audiences with similar political positions tend to consume the same media plays.
Fragmentation is a process in which the audience who originally concentrated on a small number of reading and listening options is dispersed into more and more options. The reason of fragmentation is that the diversity of audience means that the diversity of audience preference is high and the consumption demand is rich.
YouTube has a very strong connection with American politics. In 2008, some major political party candidates started using YouTube to announce their candidacy and track announcements made through more traditional media. Social celebrities will also actively play the role of opinion leaders on YouTube.By the 2012 general election, YouTube has become the channel of choice for advertising campaigns. In addition to the political campaign and image control tools provided by YouTube, it has also become a platform for candidates to carry out advertising and fundraising efforts. YouTube can not only enhance communication, but also make politicians a tool for their own agenda-making during the election process. By observing and researching the content of YouTube, you can explore political-related content on it.
The present study uses a network analytics approach to examine the focal issues. It examines online users’ political fragmentation by a network analysis based on their co-commenting on popular singers’ music videos and political candidates’ news videos. Focusing on YouTube, a popular video social networking sites, the present study constructed a network among 10 singers who have openly expressed their political stances or supporting certain political candidates, and 10 news outlets with different political ideologies. An edge will be constructed between these popular singers and news outlets if they shared the same commenting user. This method sheds lights on how nonpolitical online public sphere and political public sphere are connected; and offers a better understanding of the affective polarization in the cultural domain. 
Related work

Previous studies have also studied the relationship between political and non political content. From a sociological point of view, by studying climate change within the American public, Aaron m concludes that liberals and Democrats are more likely to report in line with the scientific consensus(Aaron m,2011); From the perspective of social media, Benjamin Kane analyzes the comment data of message boards on reddit, and directly compares the political bias of different communities with the external corpus of politically biased words(Kane, B., & Luo, J,2018);From the perspective of media, scholars have studied the movies related to star wars and come to the conclusion that the political influence generated by manipulating social media discussion is no longer unique to political debate, but can now be found in popular culture(Bay, M,2018).
## Literature review
Music Has a Historical Relationship with Politics
Rather than an object of art, Thomas Turino considered that the music is a vital mode of engagement with people and ideas. He provided two cases in history, nationalism in Nazi Germany and the civil rights movement in the US, to demonstrate the consequences of using music in political movements (Turino Thomas, 2010). Mark Pedelty and Linda Keefe analyzed political pop music fan blogs, concluded that fans of political musicians are engaging in more political discourse than fans of the top-selling pop stars (Pedelty & Keefe, 2010).
Audience Fragmentation Theory and YouTube
Audience fragmentation often has been used to describe the complicated relationships between media and readers/listeners/receivers/consumers, especially when people increasingly use media to share within small groups of like-minded individuals (Fletcher & Nielsen, 2017). There are audience-centric approach and media-centric approach to address this question. A research on the US television audience fragmentation and polarization revealed, audient fragmentation is more advanced and polarization is also evident, but modest (James G. Webster, 2005).  
New media technologies have changed the patterns of audience behavior, as Philip Napoli pointed out in the book “Audience evolution: New technologies and the transformation of media audiences”. He also demonstrated in another article that the changing nature of media audiences (Philip M. Napoli, 2010). 
A study analyzed YouTube memes and built a network of connections between memetic videos. The Gangnam Style - related videos they searched were the nodes, and the tie between the two nodes was if the videos have the same commenter (Xu, Park, Kim & Park, 2016). A German study analyzed German far-right actors on YouTube, showed the network of these media channels and the topics users discuss, they found the community is getting denser and more centralized over time (Rauchfleisch & Kaiser, 2020). By using STM package to calculate the topic model, researchers also found that common denominator among the group YouTube sphere is the refugee crisis and related problems. Another German study focused on the counter-messages given by algorithms on YouTube, which are used to tag extremist content. The researchers used two exemplary information network analyses based on YouTube videos, demonstrate the result that counter-messages can appear directly linked to extremist content (Schmitt, Rieger, Rutkowski & Ernst, 2018). Researchers in Finland used YouTube data to analyze social movement, and they combined network analysis and qualitative analysis on anti-immigration activists (Laaksonen, Pantti & Titley, 2020). Their created three categories of video activism, including movement building through documentation, discursive controversy generation, and personal branding practices. They found the common practice of microcelebrity branding in online political communication was increasing.
The US Tradition of Singers to Show Their Political Opinions
Singers used to support social movement or protest to show their political views. Like Nobel Prize winner Bob Dylan, he published dozens of songs to show the thoughts of anti-war in 1960s (“The Politics of Bob Dylan”, 2021). In 2016, the United States president candidate Hilary Clinton won a group of high-profile singers' endorsement, including Beyoncé, Jay Z, and Bruce Springsteen (“30 celebrities who love and endorse Hillary Clinton”, 2021). Another candidate both was from Democrat Bernie Sanders also had 78 musicians who recorded a song to endorse him. Billboard even have listed the republican and democrat musicians in 2014 (“Ahead of 2016 Presidential Election, Here’s a List of Republican & Democrat Musicians”, 2021). In 2018, the country music and pop singer Taylor Swift started to endorse Democratic candidates in public which created a buzz (“A Timeline of Taylor Swift's Political Evolution”, 2021).
Research questions
We hope to find out whether there is any connection between them by studying official politically related videos and nonpolitically related videos, such as music videos. So we asked the first question:

RQ1: What is the connection between the popular music videos and political videos?
We hope to find the core video in the network through visualization, because this video often plays the role of a linker. Finding this video can help us draw conclusions more clearly, our second question is:
RQ 2: What are the most important video (s) in this network between politically related videos and music related videos？
The significance of this research question is to find the most core video in the picture through data visualization. The important point here is that it connects many videos or a specific node.
## Data and Method
### Data collection
All YouTube comments were extracted from the YouTube API using the YouTube data tool in March 2021. 
Firstly, we search for some singers who has shown their political leanings before. Five of them are Left-leaning (Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and Katy Perry) and another five singers are Right-leaning (Kanye West, Alice Cooper, Ted Nugent, Jessica Simpson and Kid rock). The news resources that show the singer's political leaning are shown in the table below.
We search for the most popular 10 songs of each singer on Spotify. And search for the official music video of each song on YouTube.
 
Then, based on a figure showing the political leanings of the news media (https://www.adfontesmedia.com), we find 5 Left-leaning media (MSNBC, HuffPost, CNN, TYT and CBS) and 5 Right-leaning media(Fox news, Newswax, New York Post, The Daily Wire and Yahoo news). On each media’s YouTube channel, find 10 most popular videos about Donald Trump and 10 most popular videos about Joe Biden. We get a total of 200 videos from 10 media organizations. Finally, we got a table containing the necessary information as shown below.
Video name	Author name	Political leaning of the author	Video type	Number of likes	Number of comments
Shallow	Lady Gaga	Left-leaning	Music Video	6,300,000	179,126
Rain on me	Lady Gaga	Left-leaning	Music Video	5,200,000	467,302

Table 1
After getting API keys from google developer platform, we use R to scrape comments from videos. We have five “Left-leaning”singers and five “Right-leaning” singers, together with their video comments. And we have ten media and twenty videos of each media, together with their comments. So, we have 20 datasets.
### Procedure
We do some data cleaning using Python. First, remove emojis. And remove comments replying to other comments to keep initial comments. Then we choose useful columns and add one column called “Video_author_id”. We find common users between each singer’s dataset and each media’s dataset. Based on the number of common users, we build a table containing the singer’s name and the media’s name.
 This network is calculated based on the connection established by the YouTube recommendation algorithm: the nodes in this Gephi graph are videos. When a user comments on two videos, the two videos will be connected. In Figure 1, User 2 left a comment on Video 1 and a comment on Video 2; User 5 left a comment on Video 3 and a comment on Video 5. So, Video 1 and Video 2 share a common user, and Video 3 and Video 5 share a common user. Video 1 and Video 2 will be connected, and Video 3 and Video 5 will be connected as shown in Figure 2.
 
Figure 1
 
Figure 2
After getting a table that can be used for Gephi, we use Gephi to draw a network between singers and media. The procedure is shown in Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5.

Figure 4: Node -> Label color -> in-degree
 
Figure 5: Node -> size -> ranking -> weighted degree
### Results

Figure 6

In Figure 6, the color represents the community which each node belongs to. For each dataset(A) which contains the comments of one singer’s 10 videos, if A shares most common users with dataset(B) which contains the comments of 20 videos about two president candidates. A and B will be rendered in one color(community). In Figure 3, the node of “Taylor_Swift” (left) shares most common users with the node of “Fox_News” (right). The nodes are both blue. We can also tell that Lady Gaga (left), Beyonce (left), Billie Ellish (left), Katy Perry (left) and Alice Cooper (right) share most common users with CNN (left), CBS (left) and Huffpost (left), so that they are in the same community. In addition, Kanye West (right), Ted Nugent (right), Kid Rock (right) and Jessica Simpson (right) share most common users with MSNBC (left), TYT (left), Newsmax (right), New York Post (right), YAHOO News (right) and the Daily Wire (right). The size of the node represents the popularity of the node. For example, among the 10 medias, the node of “CNN”and the node of “Fox_News” are the largest, which means they have more YouTube users who left comments on their videos than other medias.
The data is well collected. We plan to find out some hidden relationships between videos. There are lots of common YouTube users who left on comments on a video of Joe Biden’s inauguration ceremony and a Lady Gaga music video. We could use cosine similarity, to measure the similarity between two videos’comments. Perhaps two videos can be tied closely and we could find out the relationship. We want to do text mining of the videos’comments. A left-leaning media and a right-leaning media both has a video reporting the 2020 presidential debate, but the keywords or the topics extracted from the comments might be different. We could use TF-IDF or topic-modeling to find the keywords of both videos’comments. 
## Discussion and conclusion
In Salla-Maaria Laaksonen’s study examined the broadcasting practices and strategies of Finnish antiimmigration movements on YouTube and analyzed the construction of movement media and the intersecting emergence of individual political personalities.Their findings suggest that Finnish anti-immigration actors are aware of how YouTube has come to constitute a transnationally generative space for anti-immigration movements; one in which the consolidation of media brands and personalities has become politically productive.They suggest that under conditions of political fragmentation and media amplification, microcelebrity is a political form that occupies the political space generated by movements after the original cause and movement activism has dissipated. 
As an important social media, YouTube also provides public opinion space for the U.S. presidential election in 2020. In this space, there is a connection between the political tendency of the media and that of the singers that people are familiar with. The competition between different political parties has been magnified in Youtube, which enables us to find out the connection between music and politics through user comments. In our research, we have established links between the 10 most popular songs and videos of different political actors, and the comments of different political media on Joe Biden and Donald Trump videos. Our research results show that political fragmentation does not affect users' fragmentation in music and media organizations. Users receive news from both political parties at the same time. Left-leaning singers will also establish contact with Right-leaning media organizations.
According to Josephine B. Schmitt et al,by combining these network data with survey data and/or data of actual video users, scholars could get deeper insights into audience flows and how possible interconnections between videos are perceived by online users—for instance, how they relate to the emergence of boomerang effects or, in case of more biased users, to hostile media effects.This is even more relevant as research on audience fragmentation provides evidence for audience duplication across media outlets (Webster & Ksiazek, 2012).
Our social network analysis shows audience fragmentation on YouTube. Users who comment on the music videos of Left-leaning singers will also comment on the videos of Right-leaning media organizations. The complex relationship between media and users as well as their political tendencies can be connected through network nodes. The audience of Left-leaning singer Taylor Swift will comment under the videos of Left-leaning media CNN and Right-leaning media Fox News, and the user centered network node establish the connection between the singer and media organizations through the common comments of users.
Our research find that users who comment on Taylor Swift's music videos have more comments on Fox News videos than CNN with the same political orientation, which is not in line with our hypothesis that there will be many common user comments on singers' music videos and videos from media organizations with the same political orientation. Common user comments connect Left-leaning singer Taylor Swift with right-leaning media Fox News, and this kind of connection is more than Taylor Swift's connection with Left-leaning media CNN.But most of the singers' contact with the media is in line with our expectations, such as: through the users of common comments, Left-leaning singer Beyonce has established contact with the Left-leaning organization CNN, and their contact is very close. Beyonce is rarely associated with Right-leaning media.
Our research results show that political fragmentation does not affect users' fragmentation in music and media. The most obvious thing is that Left-leaning singer Taylor swift and Right-leaning media Fox News have the most common user comments, far more than those with Left-leaning media CNN.The reason may be that people who support Donald Trump attack or abuse under Taylor Swift's video, or it may be that Taylor Swift's fans attack Donald Trump. We don't know the specific reason, which needs further analysis. We plan to find the topics and keywords of these user comments through topic modeling, and check whether these user comments are positive or negative through sentiment analysis.
Generally speaking, our research establishes the relationship between songs and political parties, endows non politicized research topics with politicized attributes, and provides a new strategy to study audience fragmentation. Although our research reveals important findings, We still have a lot of work to do.For example, we lack of research on specific song video information, and the content and theme of the song itself need to be further studied. Through the research on the theme of the song, our network node graph will be more convincing. Both channel are based research and song based research need to be further explored and developed. From channel research to specific song research is our future research direction. Secondly, we haven't done the research on comments. We lack the classification of comments. We also need to divide comments into positive comments and negative comments to explore the deep meaning of a specific representative node. Build positive network and negative network, find out the characteristics of different networks.This can further promote the relationship between music and political parties.
